The ‘ardl‘ (Auto Regressive Distributed Lag) package estimates time series dynamic models
with lagged dependent variables and lagged regressors. It is specially useful to study time
relations when the structure of the models are not imposed a priori by theory. The flexibility
offered by a variable number of lags and the possibilty to model in levels lead to models highly
adjusted to data. The current version of this package allows for unrestricted estimations of
constant parameter models for short and long-term relations.
